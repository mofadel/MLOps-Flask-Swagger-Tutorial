# MLOps-Flask-Swagger-Tutorial
Here we show a brief introduction on how to deploy machine learning models using Flask and Swagger. Deployment is one of the last stages of the Machine Learning workflow. In this example we use the classic Iris data set, the modelling part is done on the train.py and all the steps for deployment are described in deploy.py.
